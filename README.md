# Global-Air-Pollution-Prediction-using-Random-Forest-Regressor
This project focuses on predicting global air pollution levels using the Random Forest Regressor, an ensemble machine learning algorithm.

The goal of this project is to:

Analyze global air quality datasets.

Understand key pollutants and their trends.

Build a Random Forest regression model to predict pollution levels.

Provide insights into factors contributing to air pollution.
